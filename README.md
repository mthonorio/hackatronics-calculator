# Calculator of Transistor Circuits

This project is a calculator for transistor circuits developed in React Native using TypeScript, Expo, and LaTex.

## Introduction

The Calculator of Transistor Circuits is a tool that allows users to analyze of transistor circuits. It provides a user-friendly interface and supports both NPN and PNP transistors.

## Features

- Circuit analysis: Perform detailed analysis of circuit parameters such as voltage, current, and power.
- LaTex support: Displays the formula for performing circuit calculations using LaTex.

### Future features

- Circuit design: Create and customize transistor circuits using an intuitive drag-and-drop interface.
- Component library: Access a comprehensive library of transistors and other electronic components.

## Installation

To install and run the Calculator of Transistor Circuits, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/mthonorio/hackatronics-calculator.git`
